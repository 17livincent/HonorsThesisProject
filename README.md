# HonorsThesisProject
This is a web application which allows the user to preprocess time series data files (.csv) with an easy-to-use, file-converter-like interface.  To visit the app, follow this [link](https://honorsthesiswebapp.web.app/).

It is designed for machine learning researchers/engineers or data scientists to preprocess time series data in a code-free environment.  The user can simply upload multiple files, pick the preprocessing steps from dropdowns, and download the processed data.

Front-end is designed with React, back-end with Express, and is hosted via Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions.

This project is sponsored by the Arizona State University School of Arts, Media, and Engineering.
